# today we will learn what are tupels and how to use tuples in python!! so let's start this.

tuple=(1,21,34,32,445)
print(type(tuple) , tuple)
print(len(tuple))
print(tuple[6])
print(tuple[3])
print(tuple)

# a=int(input("Enter and check the number "))
# if a in tuple:
#  print ("yes , this number is in tuple")
# else:
#  print("this number does not exist")

tuple2 = tuple[1:5]
print(tuple2 , tuple2.count(21))
